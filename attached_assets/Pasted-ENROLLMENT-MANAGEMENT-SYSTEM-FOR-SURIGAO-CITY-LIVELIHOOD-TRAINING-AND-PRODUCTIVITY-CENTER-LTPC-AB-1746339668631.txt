ENROLLMENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR SURIGAO CITY LIVELIHOOD TRAINING AND PRODUCTIVITY CENTER (LTPC)
ABSTRACT
Improving the efficiency and transparency of enrollment and training operations is essential to enhancing technical and vocational education delivery at the local level. This capstone project aims to design and implement an Enrollment Management System for the Surigao City Livelihood Training and Productivity Center (LTPC), addressing persistent issues in manual data entry, trainee tracking, and payment monitoring. The system seeks to support LTPC’s mission of providing inclusive, well-organized livelihood training programs by automating administrative tasks and enabling structured, role-based access to real-time information.
Enrollment Officers will be able to manage course offerings, create training batches, register trainees, assign trainers, and upload related documents. Admin and PESDO Officers will benefit from a centralized dashboard where they can monitor enrollments, training progress, assessment results, and payment statuses, as well as handle employment endorsements. Cashiers will manage payment records, assign receipt numbers, and generate financial reports efficiently.
The proposed system enhances decision-making and service delivery by streamlining core workflows and reducing manual errors. It also contributes to Surigao City's broader digital transformation goals and provides a replicable model for other local training centers.

1. INTRODUCTION 
The Surigao City Livelihood Training and Productivity Center (LTPC) plays a pivotal role in equipping local residents with employable skills through technical and vocational education. However, the institution’s continued reliance on manual processes for enrollment, monitoring, and payment tracking presents major operational inefficiencies. These outdated systems are prone to human error, lost records, and slow processing times, which hinder the center’s ability to respond effectively to increasing demands from the community.
Currently, Enrollment Officers manage data manually through paper forms and spreadsheets, making it difficult to track the growing number of training participants and batches. Similarly, Cashiers handle payment records with minimal automation, which increases the risk of inaccuracies in financial reporting. Admin and PESDO Officers lack real-time visibility into the status of enrollments, training completions, and payment compliance, limiting their ability to make timely, data-driven decisions. This inefficiency negatively impacts institutional transparency and weakens LTPC’s ability to provide quality services and track program outcomes.
The proposed project aims to address these challenges by designing and implementing a role-based, web-based Enrollment Management System tailored to LTPC’s administrative and operational needs. This system will streamline enrollment workflows, centralize trainee data, and automate payment tracking. Each user type—Admin Staff, PESDO Officers, Enrollment Officers, and Cashiers—will have access to features specifically designed to support their responsibilities. Real-time dashboards and automated reports will allow administrators to easily monitor enrollment trends, training progress, and employment endorsements.
Integrating this system into LTPC’s day-to-day operations will not only improve efficiency but also strengthen data accuracy, internal coordination, and institutional accountability. Administrative staff will spend less time managing paperwork and more time focusing on strategic goals such as improving training quality and enhancing community outreach. Meanwhile, the system will serve as a reliable digital archive for trainee and program records, minimizing the risks of data loss and providing long-term benefits for institutional continuity.
Finally, this initiative supports the broader vision of digital governance in Surigao City by modernizing one of its key public service institutions. As local governments across the Philippines pursue digital transformation, LTPC’s adoption of this system can serve as a scalable model for other livelihood training centers in the region. This project not only aims to address current operational limitations but also positions LTPC to deliver more inclusive, transparent, and technology-driven education services for years to come.
1. 1 Project Context
LTPC is an essential institution that supports the economic development of Surigao City by providing skills training to its residents. However, growing enrollment numbers and increasing administrative demands have exposed the limitations of its manual system. Misplaced documents, delayed reports, and inaccurate records have hindered both operational efficiency and trainee support services.
This capstone project responds to those challenges by proposing a centralized Enrollment Management System tailored specifically to LTPC’s needs. The system will provide user-friendly interfaces and role-based access for managing courses, tracking training progress, processing payments, and generating reports. It will significantly reduce time-consuming paperwork and enable staff to focus on training quality and outcomes.
By digitizing LTPC’s processes, the project contributes to improving public service delivery and supports the city’s long-term vision for digital transformation in education and workforce development.	
1. 2 Purpose and Description
The purpose of this project is to develop a web-based Enrollment Management System for the Surigao City Livelihood Training and Productivity Center (LTPC) that streamlines enrollment, trainee monitoring, and payment tracking. The system allows Enrollment Officers to manage course offerings and trainee records, Admin and PESDO Officers to monitor training progress and employment referrals through real-time dashboards, and Cashiers to process and report on trainee payments. The system improves data accuracy, reduces manual workload, and supports faster and more transparent administrative processes.
1. 3 General Objectives of the Study
The main objective of this study is to develop an Enrollment Management System for the Surigao City Livelihood Training and Productivity Center (LTPC) that enhances the efficiency, accuracy, and transparency of enrollment, trainee monitoring, and payment processes. The study specifically aims to:
1.	To develop a user-friendly system that allows Enrollment Officers to manage courses, register trainees, assign trainers, and upload training documents.
2.	To provide Admin and PESDO Officers with real-time dashboards and reporting tools for tracking enrollment data, course progress, and employment endorsements.
3.	To simplify payment tracking by enabling Cashiers to record transactions, generate receipts, and produce financial reports efficiently.
4.	To improve the overall accuracy and accessibility of trainee and course records through secure and centralized data management.
5.	To support LTPC’s goal of delivering high-quality training services and advancing Surigao City’s digital governance initiatives.
1. 4 Scope and Limitations 
The following are the scope of the study:
1.	The system allows Enrollment Officers to manage course information, create training batches, register trainees, assign trainers, and upload training-related documents.
2.	The system supports four types of users—Admin Staff, PESDO Officers, Enrollment Officers, and Cashiers—each with their own role-specific dashboard and features.
3.	Admin and PESDO Officers can view real-time dashboards to monitor enrollment numbers, course progress, assessment results, and employment referrals.
4.	Cashiers can record trainee payments, assign receipt numbers, and generate payment reports.
5.	The system provides secure, role-based login access to ensure that only authorized personnel can access and manage sensitive data.
The following are the limitations of the study:
1.	The system will only be accessible on desktop or laptop computers within the LTPC facility and will not support mobile access.
2.	The system will not support integration with external platforms such as learning management systems (LMS), national employment databases, or online payment gateways.
3.	Trainees will not have direct access to the system; all records and processes will be managed internally by LTPC staff.
